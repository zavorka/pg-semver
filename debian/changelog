pg-semver (0.30.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * ***** WARNING: This release breaks compatibility with previous versions! ******
    Previous versions of the semver extension incorrectly allowed some
    invalid prerelease and build metadata values. Details below, but *BEFORE
    YOU UPGRADE* we strongly recommend that you check for and repair any
    invalid semvers. You can find them using the official [SemVer regular
    expression](https://regex101.com/r/vkijKf/1/) like so:

    SELECT name, version FROM packages
     WHERE version::text !~ '^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)'
                            '(?:-((?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)'
                            '(?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))?'
                            '(?:\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$';

    If no rows are returned, you should be good to go. If there are results,
    here are Examples of invalid semantic versions and how they should be
    repaired.

        1.0.0-02799   ->   1.0.0-2799
        1.0.0-0.02    ->   1.0.0-0.2
        1.0.0-.20     ->   1.0.0-0.20
        1.0.0+0+20    ->   1.0.0+0-20  or  1.0.0+0.20
        1.0.0+.af     ->   1.0.0+0.af  or  1.0.0+af

    And now, back to your regularly-scheduled changes.

  * Fixed an error formatting prerelease parts for semvers longer than
    32 bytes. Thanks to @Nemo157 for the report and suggested fix (#48).
  * Removed code that converted dashes to dots in prerelease parts. It
    had been doing so on the assumption that dashes were invalid in SemVer
    1.0 and 2.0 prerelease parts, but that does not turn out to be the case.
    Thanks to @Nemo157 for the report (#46).
  * Fixed the parsing of prerelease and metadata parts to allow leading
    zeros for parts with non-numeric characters, e.g., `1.0.0-alpha.0a`, and
    to disallow parts with leading zeros and only numeric characters, e.g.,
    `1.0.0-02799`. Thanks to @Nemo157 for the bug report, and to Joseph
    Donahue for the SemVer spec expertise (#45).
  * The metadata part may no longer contain plus signs other than the one
    used to start the metadata part.
  * The prerelease and metadata parts may no longer start with a dot.

pg-semver (0.22.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed `get_semver_prerelease()` so that it returns only the
    prerelease without any build metadata. For example, for
    `1.0.0-1.2+1.02`, it will now return `1.2`, not `1.2+1.02`. Thanks
    to Artur Troian for the report (#41) and fix (#42)!

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Thu, 2 Apr 2020 14:13:55 +0000

pg-semver (0.21.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed build metadata part to allow leading zeros. In other words,
    `1.0.0-1.02` is not a legitimate semver, because it has a leading zero
    in a numeric part of the prerelease version. `1.0.0-1.2+1.02`, however,
    is valid, because the leading zero numeric expression is in the build
    metadata part, which does not evaluate as numeric, and so is allowed.
    This fix allows source code hashes, for example, to be used in build
    metadata. Thanks to Artur Troian for the report (#38) and fix (#39)!

pg-semver (0.20.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed test failure on Postgres 11 due to a renamed column that this
    extension doesn't even use for testing.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Sat, 10 Nov 2018 19:32:26 +0000

pg-semver (0.20.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    @ninjaslikecheese for the report (#33).

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Fri, 19 Oct 2018 02:05:11 +0000

pg-semver (0.20.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

pg-semver (0.17.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Arun Tejasvi Chaganty (Issue #29).

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Sun, 07 May 2017 07:15:25 +0000

pg-semver (0.16.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Added `get_semver_*` accessor functions to retrieve the individual
    parts of a semver, thanks to Geoff Montee (PR #27).

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Sun, 04 Dec 2016 00:51:19 +0000

pg-semver (0.15.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Fixed incorrect parsing of semver build metadata.
  * Fixed text foratting of build metadata-only semver values.
  * Implemented pre-release precedence scheme as per semantic versioning
    2.0.0 section 11. Thanks to Sergey Kozlov for the report (Issue #23).
  * Added Xavier Caron and Tom Davis as maintainers.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Fri, 28 Oct 2016 03:38:59 +0000

pg-semver (0.14.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Updated the extension version in `semver.control` to 0.13.0, which
    evidently I forgot to do for that release. Thanks to Stanislav Lorenc
    for the report (Issue #21).

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Thu, 11 Aug 2016 05:38:27 +0000

pg-semver (0.13.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Fixed bug where a dash (-) was disallowed within the metadata part of
    a semver. Thanks to @TerraTech for the report (Issue #19) and Tom
    Davis for the fix (PR #20).

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Sat, 30 Jul 2016 21:06:15 +0000

pg-semver (0.12.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Fixed bug where some items described in the SemVer 2.0.0 Spec, section
    10, were not properly recognized as semvers. Thanks to Xavier Caron
    for the fix (with tests!) (PR #17).

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Sat, 11 Jun 2016 06:00:19 +0000

pg-semver (0.11.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Added `is_semver()`, thanks to a pull request from Xavier Caron
    (PR #14).
  * Fixed bug where version parts with non-leading 0 were considered
    invalid. Thanks to @JeremySTX for the report (Issue #15) and Tom Davis
    for the fix (PR #16).

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Mon, 23 May 2016 20:29:49 +0000

pg-semver (0.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Updated extension to support Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, thanks to Tom
    Davis (PR #13).
  * Improved error output to mark specific bad character, where possible,
    thanks to Tom Davis.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: `semver()` and cast constructors no longer support
    the semver 1.0.0-beta format format "X.Y.Zpre" (that is, without the
    dash), since it's not compatible with the semver 2.0.0 spec. Use
    `to_semver()` to convert it to X.Y.Z-pre", or specify "X.Y.Z-pre"
    directly.

pg-semver (0.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium   

  * Fixed issue where the release file could be listed twice when
    installing, which causes an installation failure on some versions of
    PostgreSQL.
  * Fixed a typo in the README: `make installcheck` should be run *after*
    `make install`.
  * Fixed an issue where the installer would read the distribution version
    rather than the extension version. The latter is requierd to tell
    PostgreSQL the correct version number (since the distribution version
    is quite different from the extension version).
  * Added `LICENSE` file to simplify packaging, thanks to Richard Marko,
    who is packaging semver for Fedora.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Sat, 06 Dec 2014 00:29:17 +0000

pg-semver (0.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Updated the `Makefile` to reflect the recommended patterns from
    pgsql-hackers. Thanks to CÃ©dric Villemain for the details.
  * Changed the Makefile to read the distribution name and version from
    META.json.
  * Fixed the Makefile to allow `PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config` to actually
    work.
  * Fixed an off-by-one bug in the parser that could add garbage
    characters to the end of certain semvers with patch versions. Thanks
    to Andrew "RhodiumToad" Gierth for pointing out the bug.
  * Add a macro to fetch a semver from C function arguments, and cast to
    `semver*` rather than `void*`. Suggested by Andrew "RhodiumToad"
    Gierth.
  * Removed unnecessary calls to `PG_FREE_IF_COPY()`. Only really needed
    for toastable values, and semvers are not toastable.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Wed, 12 Jun 2013 06:48:33 +0000

pg-semver (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Updated the parser to support an optional dash before the prerelease
    version, and the formatter to always emit a dash for the prerelease
    version. This brings it in line with the final semver 1.0.0
    specification. Thanks to Pieter van de Bruggen for making it happen.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Tue, 20 Nov 2012 19:04:30 +0000

pg-semver (0.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium  

  * Fixed a memory allocation bug that could cause semvers to be displayed
    with missing or garbage characters. Thanks to Andrew "RhodiumToad"
    Gierth for help tracking down and fixing the issue.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Fri, 02 Nov 2012 22:32:30 +0000

pg-semver (0.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium 

  * Fixed the `Makefile` so that the documentation file should properly be
    found and installed by `PGXS`.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Fri, 11 Nov 2011 06:55:10 +0000

pg-semver (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium   

  * Tweaked MultiMarkdown table layout in the docuemntation so that the
    header row is always processed as a header row, rather than a `pre`
    block.
  * Simplified the `CREATE EXTENSION` support in the `Makefile`.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Thu, 12 May 2011 19:01:41 +0000

pg-semver (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium 

  * Fixed the metadata file to reflect that the "pair" extension is not
    included in the semver distribution.
  * Added abstract and doc file to the `provides` section of `META.json`.
  * Removed the `NO_PGXS` stuff from `Makefile`, as the PostgreSQL core
    team does not recommend its use outside of the core contrib
    extensions.
  * Added PostgreSQL 9.1 `CREATE EXTENSION` support, including migration
    from an unpackaged install via `CREATE EXTENSION semver FROM
    unpackaged`.
  * Renamed `doc/semver.md` to `doc/semver.mdd`, so that PGXN will parse
    it as MultiMarkdown. This will allow the tables to be properly
    formatted.
  * Removed documentation that semver is implemented as a domain. It
    hasn't been since 0.2.0.
  * Removed Unicode characters `psql` output in the documentation.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Wed, 20 Apr 2011 20:37:05 +0000

pg-semver (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium 

  * Converted to a native type implemented in C by Sam Vilain. While David
    was at lunch, no less.
  * As a consequence, `USING` is no longer required in an `ORDER BY`
    clause to get proper semver sort ordering.
  * Added casts from nuermic types.
  * Renamed `clean_semver()` to `to_semver()`.

 -- David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.com>  Sat, 05 Feb 2011 19:32:49 +0000

pg-semver (0.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial version.
  * Implementation in pure PL/pgSQL.
  * Included in [PGXN Manager](https://github.com/theory/pgxn-manager).
  * Not otherwise released.
